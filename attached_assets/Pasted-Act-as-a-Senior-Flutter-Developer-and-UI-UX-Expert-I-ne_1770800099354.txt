Act as a Senior Flutter Developer and UI/UX Expert.
I need you to build a complete, production-ready mobile app called "Neighbor Storage (이웃창고)" using Flutter in this Replit environment.
This is a Hyper-Local Item Rental Platform (C2C & B2C) targeting Uiwang-si, Korea.
The goal is to create a fully functional UI prototype with Mock Data that looks exactly like a real app.
1. Project Identity & Design System
• App Name: Neighbor Storage (이웃창고)
• Concept: "My neighborhood is my warehouse."
• Primary Color: 0xFFFFD700 (Mustard Yellow - Warmth & Trust)
• Secondary Color: 0xFF333333 (Dark Gray - Text)
• Background Color: 0xFFFFFFFF (White)
• Surface Color: 0xFFF5F5F5 (Light Gray for Cards)
• Accent Color: 0xFFFF4500 (Orange for "Express" tags)
• Typography: Use Google Fonts 'Noto Sans KR' (or system default sans-serif).
• Style: Card-based UI, Rounded corners (16px), Clean & Modern (like Karrot Market).
1. Tech Stack
• Framework: Flutter (Latest Stable)
• State Management: flutter_riverpod (Must use for managing Mock Data)
• Navigation: go_router (Implement ShellRoute for persistent Bottom Navigation)
• Icons: lucide_icons
• Utils: intl (For currency formatting, e.g., "10,000원")
• Image: cached_network_image
1. Core Features & Business Models (Crucial Requirements)
You must implement the UI and Logic for these specific features:
Feature A: Pro Partners (B2C Rental)
• Concept: Local shops (Hardware stores, Camping shops) listing items.
• Implementation:
• Create a boolean field 'isShopOwner' in the User model.
• On the Home Screen, create a Horizontal Scroll Section at the very top titled "👑 우리 동네 프로 샵 (Pro Partners)".
• Only items from users with 'isShopOwner = true' appear here.
• On the Item Detail Screen, show a badge: "전문가 검수 완료 (Pro Checked)".
Feature B: Express Delivery (Quick Matching)
• Concept: Getting the item delivered via a neighbor rider.
• Implementation:
• On the 'Checkout Screen', create a Radio Button Group for "Receive Method".
• Option 1: "직접 수령 (Pick up)" - +0 KRW
• Option 2: "⚡️ 이웃 퀵 (Neighbor Express)" - +3,000 KRW
• The Total Price should update dynamically based on this selection.
Feature C: Escrow System (Deposit)
• Concept: Holding the deposit securely.
• Implementation:
• On the 'Checkout Screen', clearly separate the "Rental Fee" and "Deposit".
• Show a message: "보증금은 안전하게 보관되며 반납 시 환불됩니다."
Feature D: Knowledge Share
• Concept: Teaching how to use the tool.
• Implementation:
• Create a boolean field 'canTeach' in the Item model.
• If true, display a highlighted tag on the Item Detail Screen: "💡 사용법 알려드려요 (Usage Lesson Available)".
1. Navigation Structure (5 Tabs)
Use 'ScaffoldWithNavBar' logic to persist these 5 tabs.
The Center Tab (Upload) must look like a Floating Action Button.
Tab 1: Home (index)
• Top: Location Bar ("오전동" dropdown), Search Button, Notification Bell.
• Body:
1. "Pro Partners" Horizontal List.
2. "Recent Items" Vertical List (Infinite Scroll style).
• FAB: Map Icon (Bottom Right).
Tab 2: Chat (chat)
• Simple Chat Room List UI.
Tab 3: Upload (upload)
• This should be the CENTER button.
• Make the icon larger and circular (Floating style).
• Clicking it opens a Modal (showModalBottomSheet) for listing an item.
Tab 4: My Storage (my_storage)
• Inventory Management.
• Wallet Section showing "Held Deposits".
Tab 5: Settings (settings)
• Profile and App Settings.
1. Data Structure (Mock Data)
Create a 'MockDataService' using Riverpod to populate the app.
• User Model: id, nickname, isShopOwner, shopName, trustScore.
• Item Model: id, ownerId, title, category, pricePerDay, deposit, isProItem, canTeach, canDeliver, imageUrl.
Please generate 15 realistic dummy items for "Uiwang-si" context:
• 5 Items from "Pro Partners" (e.g., "Camping Club", "Uiwang Tools").
• 10 Items from "Normal Neighbors".
• Use 'picsum.photos' for random realistic images.
1. Execution Plan
• Step 1: Update pubspec.yaml with dependencies.
• Step 2: Create the folder structure (features/home, features/chat, features/shared, etc.).
• Step 3: Implement the Data Models and Mock Service.
• Step 4: Implement the Navigation (GoRouter + ShellRoute).
• Step 5: Build the Screens (Home, Detail, Checkout).
• Step 6: Run the app.
Now, write the code. Focus on creating a beautiful, functional UI that I can test immediately.
